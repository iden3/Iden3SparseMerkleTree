        This document is a draft specification developed by Polygon and is provided for public review and feedback. The current version of the document is a work in progress and may be subject to changes or updates based on community input, technical advancements, or further research.

        The specification has not yet been submitted to, reviewed, or approved by any formal standards organization such as the W3C. However, it is intended to align closely with the existing W3C recommendations, specifications, and best practices related to decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, and digital signatures.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification presents the Iden3 Sparse Merkle Tree Signature Suite, created in 2021 for the Verifiable Credentials Data Integrity Proof specification. The suite employs a novel technique for "signing" and verifying credentials while being zk-friendly.

        Although the signature suite itself does not actively involve zero-knowledge proofs, its design is conducive to privacy-preserving computations and can be easily integrated with zkSNARKs and other zero-knowledge proof systems. This document details the components, structure, and implementation guidance for the Iden3 Sparse Merkle Tree Signature Suite, catering to developers, implementers, and users.

        <div class="issue">
          TODO: Verify correctness
        </div>
        <p>
          The <a>signature suite</a> incorporates a Document Merkleization algorithm to provide enhanced zero-knowledge
          compatibility support. This feature enables efficient querying of individual entries within JSON-LD documents in
          the context of zk-SNARK proofs. By constructing a Sparse Merkle Tree from the document, the algorithm supports
          selective disclosure of Verifiable Credential (VC) entries, efficiently prove membership, non-membership, and
          other predicate satisfactions related to the JSON-LD document, while maintaining the privacy and integrity of
          the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to applying the Merkleization algorithm, the document must be in its expanded and canonicalized form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Merklization algorithm works as follow:
        <ol>
          <li>Obtain a list of RDF Quads from the canonicalized document.</li>
          <li>For each Quad, construct a key-value pair where the key represents the complete type path, and the value
            corresponds to the entry's value. </li>
          <li>Insert each key-value pair into the Merkle Tree, with the key serving as the path in the tree and the leaf's
            value being the hash of the pair's value, computed using the designated <a>message digest algorithm</a>.
          <li>For each key-value pair, first hash the key using the designated <a>message digest algorithm</a>, and use
            the hashed key as the path in the Merkle Tree. Then, hash the value using the same message digest algorithm,
            and set the resulting hash as the value of the corresponding leaf node in the tree.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
  
        <p>For a detailed illustration of the Merkleization algorithm applied to a JSON-LD document, please refer to the
          <a href="#document-merkleization">example</a> provided in the Examples section of this document.</p>
  
        <h4>Selective Disclosure</h4>
  
        <p>To better comprehend how the signature suite enables selective disclosure, let us examine the underlying
          mechanism. In this process, a credential undergoes Merkleization, during which each entry of the document is
          stored in a leaf. Subsequently, the root is signed by the issuer. To facilitate selective disclosure, the prover
          can share the following information with the verifier:
  
        <ol>
          <li>The root of the Merkleized credential.</li>
          <li>The issuer's signature on the root.</li>
          <li>The relevant authentication paths for the selectively disclosed entries.</li>
        </ol>
  
        By providing this information, the prover demonstrates the possession of a valid credential containing specific
        entries without revealing the entire credential content. Consequently, this enables the prover to confirm the
        issuance of a credential of a particular type that contains specific values while preserving the confidentiality
        of other credential details. This approach aligns with W3C's official specifications and ensures data privacy
        during the verification process.

        <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          When implementing the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite, several security considerations must be taken into account to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system.
        </p>

        <section id="security-considerations-key-management">
          <h4>Key Management</h4>
          <p>
            Proper key management practices must be followed to ensure the security of private keys. This includes secure key generation, storage, and destruction. It is essential to protect private keys from unauthorized access, as the loss or compromise of a private key could lead to impersonation or unauthorized access to signed documents.

        <section id="security-considerations-cryptographic-security">
          <h4>Cryptographic Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            The security of the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite is dependent on the underlying cryptographic algorithms (Poseidon hash function and BabyJubJub signature algorithm). It is crucial to ensure that the chosen algorithms have been thoroughly analyzed and deemed secure by the cryptographic community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-considerations-merkalization">
          <h4>Document Merklization</h4>
          <p>
            The Merklization process should be carefully implemented and reviewed to ensure that it preserves the integrity of the document while allowing for efficient zero-knowledge proofs. Any vulnerabilities in the Merklization algorithm could compromise the integrity of the signed document or the privacy of the zkSNARK proofs.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="security-considerations-side-channel">
          <h4>Side Channel Attacks</h4>
          <p>
            Implementations of the BabyJubjub 2021 Signature Suite should be designed to be resistant to side-channel attacks. These attacks could involve timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic radiation analysis to extract secret information from the system. Proper countermeasures should be employed to prevent such attacks.

                      }
                  }

          }</code></pre>


        <h4>Document Merkleization</h4>
        <p>Consider the following JSON-LD document as an example:</p>
          <pre class="example"><code>
        {
          "@context": "http://schema.org/",
          "@type": "Person",
          "name": "Jane Doe",
          "jobTitle": "Professor",
          "telephone": "(425) 123-4567"
        }</code></pre>

        <p>After expanding and canonicalizing the JSON-LD document, we obtain the list of RDF Quads. The key-value pairs derived from these RDF Quads can be represented in the following table:</p>
    
        <table class="borders-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Path</th>
              <th>Value</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>http://schema.org/jobTitle</td>
              <td>Professor</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>http://schema.org/name</td>
              <td>Jane Doe</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>http://schema.org/telephone</td>
              <td>(425) 123-4567</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type</td>
              <td>http://schema.org/Person</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
    
        <p>Following the extraction of key-value pairs from the RDF Quads, we construct a Merkle tree using these pairs. For each key-value pair, the key is hashed using the designated <a>message digest algorithm</a> to obtain the path in the Merkle tree. The value is also hashed using the same algorithm, and the resulting hash serves as the value of the corresponding leaf node in the tree.</p>

        <p>The following image represents the resulting Merkle tree constructed using the hashed paths and values derived from the key-value pairs in the table above:</p>
